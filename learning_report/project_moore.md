# Beating Moore's law

### The 'old' idea
In 1965 Gordon Moore posited that because of technological advancements, the number of transistors that could be fitted on a single chip would double every few years.
This seemingly off the cuff theory turned out to be true for most of 20th century and part of the 21st century. Chip manufacturers bought into this idea that they
could keep doubling the number of transistors on a single chip, and thereby keep doubling the speed of their processors. So the focus for a long time had
been to keep making the individual processor faster in isolation. Growing up, this is exactly how I thought about my development. That every few years, the amount of
mental resources that I have, or the amount of knowledge I have would keep doubling. This lead to a belief that I alone could do everything that was required for any
venture in my life.

### The 'uh oh!' moment
However, my hypothesis, along with that of Gordon Moore, was wrong. The performance improvements predicted by Moore's law started to falter by the
end of the first decade of 21st century as the technology reached a point where the transistors where basically the size of a few atoms. At this point, it was no
longer possible for the chip manufacturers to keep doubling the number of transistors on a chip. Thanks to this course, I also came up with a similar realization
about myself that I can't keep increasing my productivity ad infinitum. I realized that it is futile to think that I can do everything that needs to be done for
a project or venture to be successful. Writing down this statement, it feels so obvious and common sense but is surprisingly difficult to really internalize.

### The solution
The analogy between myself and the chip manufacturers doesn't end here. When the chip manufacturers realized that they couldn't fit more transistors into a single
chip, they started fitting multiple chips into a single working unit and advertised that now their chips weren't faster but there were more of them in a single unit.
This was essentially the birth of multi-core processors. Was the transition perfect? No, far from it. This idea that you could now do two things instead of just one
thing, sounds really good on paper, but it turns out to be very difficult in practice. When multiple "cores" interact with each other, they have to wait for each other
for a variety of different things, they have to share memory that they don't like to share, they have to make sure that everyone is aware of the changes they are making. 
This is a gross oversimplification of how difficult it is to write code for a parallel processor. However, with effort, patience and discipline, multiple cores do indeed
lead to better performance. 

This progression mirrors my own progression throughout this course. I too realized that it is not possible for me to do everything alone and that I needed to rely on
my team mates in order to finish the work. However, like in the case of chip manufacturers, I realized that the reality of collaboration is much messier than it looks.
Every individual has a different set of abilities, a different set of values, and a different world view. This makes it very difficult to align a team to work together
towards a single goal. However, like in the case of chip manufacturers, it is possible to do by having patience, discipline and the willingness to persevere despite
the challenges. In the end, I too found that it is worth putting in the effort to become more collaborative cause moore's law no longer holds for me.
