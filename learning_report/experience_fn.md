Even though we resolved our conflicts during the first quarter and were more cohesive as a team, I learned different kinds of things in life. While the first quarter focused on ensuring the team worked, the second quarter was more focused on optimizing and streamlining the processes within our team. Thankfully, we had a person from industrial design on our team to come help with that.

## Learnings (or "Things Anne-linde taught me")
1. **Plan, and Plan for that plan to fail**: An important idea that I got from the planning approach suggested by Anne-linde was the idea of having multi layered plans. Having a plan for a day is good, but it is highly likely that plan will fail. On the other end of the spectrum, having a plan for the next year is good to have but it doesn't provide guidance on what to do next. Having multiple layers of plans with different levels of granularity is the right idea. It is something that I have also applied in this approach in my own planning.
2. **Focus on teams rather than processes**: It is nice to have different processes but in the end, it is the team that has to implement those processes. The abstract ideas of "lean", "agile", "sprints" etc are simply guidelines that highlight something useful. The onus of tailoring these ideas falls on the shoulders of teams.
