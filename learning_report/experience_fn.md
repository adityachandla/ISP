# Hestiacare (Amazing team)
Even though we resolved our conflicts during the first quartile and were more cohesive as a team, I learned different kinds of things in life. While the first quartile focused on making sure the team worked, the second quartile was more focused on optimizing and streamlining the processes inside our team. Thankfully, we had a person from industrial design in our team to come help with that.

## Learnings (or "Things Anne-linde taught me")
1. **Plan, and Plan for that plan to fail**: An important idea that I got from the planning approach suggested by Anne-linde was the idea of having multi layered plans. Having a plan for a day is good but it is highly likely for that plan to fail. On the other end of the spectrum, plan for the next year is good to have but it doesn't tell you what to do next. Having multiple layers of plans with different level of granularity is the right idea. It is something that I have applied in my daily planning as well.
2. **Focus on teams rather than processes**: It is nice to have different processes but in the end, it is the team that has to implement those processes. The abstract ideas of "lean", "agile", "sprints" etc are simply guidelines that highlight something useful. The onus of tailoring these ideas falls on the shoulders of teams.
