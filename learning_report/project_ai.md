# Artificial Inference (AI)

ChatGPT is all the rage nowadays. Its responses to prompts are eerily similar to human responses. However, like most technological advancements, it's not magic. Generative models are simply given a very large body of texts and their primary job is to answer the question: "From all the text I've seen, which word has the highest probability to come after the user's question". Critics of such systems have therefore named systems like these "Stochastic parrots". And these stochastic parrots only know what has been presented to them in their training data. Now their training data, although huge, cannot contain complete information about everything. Therefore, these models sometimes tell us things based on very limited data a.k.a 'These systems hallucinate'. For example, if the system was only trained with very few examples of the english language, it wouldn't generate the kind of responses it does today, its responses would look more like this:

That's all nice and dandy but what does this have to do with ISP? Well it provides all the right terminology to explain my learnings ðŸ˜…. 

## Humans also hallucinate
Throughout this course, I learned that we as humans are also prone to hallucination. Whenever we were brainstorming ideas, I noticed that everyone's ideas were informed by their own limited set of "training data". Like ChatGPT, no one knows everything, so we often end up hallucinating about what works and what doesn't work. This is where the primary tenet of this course, "Validation", comes into the picture. Prima facie, it seems like a simple idea but it requires a lot of effort and deliberate practice.

## What did I learn about validation?
With regards to validation, I learned the following things:
1. We should always make sure that all our assumptions are validated. I also learned that the customer is not always the right person to get validation for all aspects of the product. For example, customer may not be the best person when it comes to how much we should charge them for the product ðŸ˜Š. 
2. I also learned that the validation strategy should consist of one part real world research and one part literature review. If the problem we are trying to solve is indeed a major problem then literature review is likely to yield valuable insights.
3. I learned the importance of having a diverse team. If you have people from different backgrounds on a team, it becomes more likely that someone's "training data" is different from yours. Therefore it becomes less likely that we as a team end up "hallucinating".
