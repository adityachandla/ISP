# Learning what to learn
With the advent of internet, the problem has shifted from "How to learn" to "What to learn". In my opinion, this is a much harder problem to tackle than the first one. It requires a deep introspection of ones priorities and goals. For this quest, I believe Esther's session was a good starting point. In this document I first go over what I learned and then talk about how I tweaked her ideas to provide me with a better framework to answer the question "What to learn".


## Learnings from Esther's workshop
I think that the concept of "want to do" vs "should do" is really powerful. As a person who grew up in an extremely competetive environment, the idea that I'm free to do whatever I want to do seemed childish, naive and detached from reality. However hard it may have been to swallow that pill, thinking deeply about that idea was really transformative. Equipped with this idea, I refined my understanding of what to do in life and came up with the following framework.

## Two tiered answer to "What to learn"
My initial approach to answer this question had been to look at objective data about what is more valuable to learn. What was left unsaid in that approach was that I was trying to find what is most valuable **, according to others,** that I should learn.
