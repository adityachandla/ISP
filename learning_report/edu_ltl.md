# Learning what to learn
With the advent of internet, the problem has shifted from "How to learn" to "What to learn". In my opinion, this is a much harder problem to tackle than the first one. It requires a deep introspection of ones priorities and goals. For this quest, I believe Esther's session was a good starting point. In this document I first go over what I learned and then talk about how I tweaked her ideas to provide me with a better framework to answer the question "What to learn".


## Learnings from Esther's workshop
I think that the concept of "want to do" vs "should do" is really powerful. As a person who grew up in an extremely competetive environment, the idea that I'm free to do whatever I want to do seemed childish, naive and detached from reality. However hard it may have been to swallow that pill, thinking deeply about that idea was really transformative. Equipped with this idea, I refined my understanding of what to do in life and came up with the following framework.

## Two tiered answer to "What to learn"
My initial approach to answer this question had been to look at objective data about what is more valuable to learn. What was left unsaid in that approach was that I was trying to find what is most valuable **, according to others,** that I should learn. I still believe researching about what to learn is an important step but it comes after you have clearly delineated what you want to do. So the first step is to discover what you want to learn, which is akin to painting with a rather broad brush, and then the second step is to hone in on the specifics using research and facts. 

## How did it help me?
Using this framework in context of my professional career, I came up with a much better learning plan for myself. I won't bore you with the details but as a result of my learnings in this course, that plan is much more focused while also being in line with what I want. Apart from that, I found that I really wanted to improve my writing skills but I had been putting that off because it didn't have any immediate benefit. I have since started devoting more time to improve my writing.

## Conclusion
By tweaking Esther's idea of "want" vs "should", I was able to come up with a more focused learning portfolio for various facets of my life.
