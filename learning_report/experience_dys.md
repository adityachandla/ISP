# HestiaCare (dysfunctional)
The first few weeks and months of this course led to a team environment that I was unhappy and dissatisfied with. This was the case for the majority of people in the team. This page outlines why did this happen and the changes I made to my personal approach to make sure that it does not happen again.

## Reasons
There were a number of reasons why I think we ended up in a rut:
1. We did not understand each others working style and expectations. 
2. As a result of not having any structure, some of us entered a state of ambivalence while some(read: me) of us became more aggressive with our own ideas. 
3. We became attached to ideas rather than the goal.


## Result
In retrospect, these things were a gift because they are the textbook definition of what not to do in a team. It is one thing to hear someone say why an approach is wrong and it is an entirely different ball game to experience it first hand. We came out of this situation as a team by the means of communication and respectful discussion. That discussion was the single most important learning I've had, not only in this course, but my life.

As a result of that discussion I learned the following things:
1. Everyone is a reasonable person in their own framework of being. If you can find a way to work with that framework, you will inevitably find common ground and find a way to move forward.
2. It is helpful to strive for involvement of other people in every decision that is made. Steamrolling over others' ideas and not giving everyone time to get on-board with your ideas is a surefire way to misery.
3. A team is like a tree; it needs nurturing, patience and hard work before you can reap its fruit.
